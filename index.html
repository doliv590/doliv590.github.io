	<header><h1>This is <em>still</em> a motherfucking website.</h1>
	<aside>And it's more fucking perfect that the last guy's (true)</aside></header>
	<h2>Seriously, its takes minimal fucking effort to improve this shit.</h2>
	<h3>7 fucking declarations.</h3>
	<p> Thats how much CSS it took to turn that <a href="motherfuckingwebsite.com">grotesque pile os shit</a> into this easy-ti-read masterpiece. It's so fucking simple and it <em>still</em> has all the glory of the original perfect-ass website:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Shit's <em>still</em> lightweight and loads fast</li>
		<li><em>Still</em> fits on all your shitty screens</li>
		<li><em>Still</em> looks the same in all your shitty browsers</li>
		<li>the Motherfucker's<em>still</em> accessible to every asshole that visit your site</li>
		<li>Shit's<em>still</em> legible and get your fucking point across.</element></li>
	</ul>
	<h3>And guess what, motherfucker:</h3>
	<p>You never knew it, but it's easy to improve readability on your site. Here's how</p>
	<h2>Let it breathe</h2>
	<p>Looj at lines 1 and 2 of some shitty website you're building. Assuming they're not married they probably shouldn't be humping. The defaukt are trash --pisk a minimum line-height: 1.4 for body copy. Headings should be tighter. If you can't see that... piss off.</p>
	<p>If your text hits the side of the browser, fuck off forever. You ever see a book like that ? Yes? What a shitty book.</p>
	<h2>A little less contrats</h2>
	<p>Black on white ? How often do you see that kind of contrast in real life? Tone it down a bit, asshole. I would've even made this site's background a nice #EEEEEE if I wasn't so focused on keeping declarations to a lean 7 fucking lines.</p>
	<h2>Size Matters</h2>=
	<p>I know your partner says otherwise, but it's true. Bump that body copy to render close to 16px or more. Smaller type works for for prints, not the screen</p>
	<h2>Line-width, motherfucker</h2>
	<p>Looking at an LCD screen is strainful enought. Don't make me read a line a text that's 200 fucking characters long. Keep it to a nice 60-80 and users might actuallt read more one sentence of your worthless dribble.</p>
	<h2>Yes, this is <em>also</em> fucking staire, you fuck</h2>
	<p>I love what the creator of <a href="motherfuckingwebsite.com">this site's inspiration</a> did. What I'm saying is that it's sin si simplle to make sites easier to read. Websites are broken by default, they are functional, high-performing, and accessible, but they're also fucking ugly. You and all the other web designers out there need to make them not total shit</p>
